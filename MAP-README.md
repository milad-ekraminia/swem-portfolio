# 🗺️ Map Component

## 📌 Introduction
This component provides an interactive map to display provinces and their cities.  
It is designed for systems that need to visualize **regional data** (province/city level) based on values retrieved from a backend API.

---

## ⚙️ Data Structure
The map requires **two JSON files**:

1. **Provinces JSON**  
   Contains geometry and properties for each province.

2. **Cities JSON**  
   Contains geometry and properties for cities.  
   This file should be requested from the API **based on the selected province**.

> ⚠️ In the current version, JSON files are added manually. In the final implementation, they must be retrieved from the backend API.

---

## 🗺️ Display Modes
- **Country view (Provinces):**  
  At the start, the map shows all provinces.
- **Province view (Cities):**  
  When a province is clicked, the corresponding cities are fetched from the API and displayed.

---

## 🧩 Main States
- `selectedProvince` → Currently selected province (used to filter cities)  
- `filteredCities` → Cities belonging to the selected province  
- `zoom` → Map zoom level (low for provinces, higher for cities)  
- `centerPosition` → Map center coordinates based on selected province/country  
- `keyNumber` → Forces a full re-render of `MapContainer` whenever the province changes

---

## 🎨 Province & City Styling
- Both provinces and cities are styled based on the value of `feature.properties.shapeValue`.  
- The function `getColorByValue` applies system-defined thresholds:

| Condition (`shapeValue`) | Color |
|---------------------------|-------|
| > 80 | 🔴 Red (`#F04438`) |
| > 40 | 🟠 Orange (`#F79009`) |
| > 20 | 🟡 Yellow (`#FDB022`) |
| ≤ 20 | ⚪ Gray (`#F2F4F7`) |

---

## 🔄 Workflow
1. Fetch the **Provinces JSON** from the backend API and render them on the map.  
2. On province click → fetch the **Cities JSON** for that province from the backend.  
3. Render cities and apply styles based on `shapeValue`.  
4. Allow users to return to the **country view** (provinces).

## 📥 Dependencies
- [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) → Map rendering  
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) → Core map engine  
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) → Optional styling support  

---

## 📌 Notes
- JSON files are currently used locally for demonstration.  
- In production, provinces and cities must be loaded via API calls.  
- `keyNumber` ensures that the `MapContainer` fully re-renders on province change.  
- If the user zooms out below a defined level, the map resets back to the **country view**.
